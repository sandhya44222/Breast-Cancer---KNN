This project implements a Breast Cancer Classification model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The aim is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign, providing an automated and reliable decision-support system for early cancer detection. The workflow includes data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, train-test split), model selection and training (tuning K values for optimal performance), and evaluation using cross-validation, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.

The KNN classifier achieved strong results with 97.8% training accuracy, 96.4% testing accuracy, and a ROC-AUC score of 0.96, showing excellent classification performance. The repository contains data, notebooks, source code, results (confusion matrix, ROC curve), and a detailed report. To reproduce the results, simply clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the provided notebook. This project highlights the effectiveness of KNN for medical diagnosis and can be extended with advanced models like Random Forest, SVM, or Deep Learning for further improvements.
